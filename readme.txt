Tool to embed a tournament on your page with administration features



== Description ==

Like me you need a tool to manage an internal tournament for your badminton club website and didn't find anything to fill exactly your need...
Maybe Bad Tournament can help you.

Feedback is welcome for thie initial release, because I can't figure all your need. ;)

This tool allows administrators to create and manage different tournaments like:
- Grinding tournament
- Swiss System
- KO System (in future Version 2.x)
- League (in future Version 2.x)

You will be able to manage clubs, players, matches...

With help of few shortcodes, it's really easy to display infos ( tournament summary, table, matches...) on the frontend website.


= Layout customizable =

There is no option to directly edit the layout, but if you have css knowledge you can customize the layout on the frontend site.

You can edit your theme css file or better add a bad-tournament.css file in your theme folder.
