Tool to embed a tournament on your page with administration features



== Description ==

I need a tool to manage an internal tournament for our badminton club website (BVG Goldbach/Laufach) and didn't find anything to fill exactly my need...
So I did this one. :)

Be careful with this first release, it's probably buggy like I didn't test it enough !

This tool allows administrators to create and manage different tournaments like:
- Grinding tournament
- Swiss System
- KO System (in Version 2.x)
- League (in Version 2.x)

Simple, double or mixed are allowed.

With help of few shortcodes, it's really easy to display infos ( tournament summary, table, matches...) on the frontend website.



== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/bad-tournament` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the 'Bad Tournament' Link to manage your tournaments
4. Create a tournament
5. Add (or not) clubs
6. Add players
7. Generate first matches
8. Add shortcodes to your pages or posts



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize the layout ? =

Currently, there is no included option in the admin area.
You will need to overwritte the bad_tournament.css file with your theme css.
As developer it's not hard to do, for common user... probabyl wait for futures releases. ;)
